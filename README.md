# monkeypox-detection-tool
Uses VGG-16, a pre-trained CNN model to detect Monkeypox using skin lesionsâ€™ image. Monkeypox is classified from other diseases with similar skin lesions such as Chickenpox and Measles. VGG-16 is fine-tuned and additional layers are added to improve the accuracy of the model. It can be used in places where PCR tests are not readily available.
